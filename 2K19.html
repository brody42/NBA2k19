<h1>Best Dribble Moves:</h1>
<h3>In and out: Press R2/RT while moving the right stick toward the hoop. Make sure to release the right stick quickly as to not stop your dribble. This move makes it look like your going inside, only to cut it back outside. The benefit here is that you can end up either tricking the defender early or late, meaning that either an inside or outside dribbling lane can open up.</h3>
<h3>Hesitation: Move the right stick in the direction of your dribbling hand and release quickly to perform a slow-motion move in that direction. The hesitation move can trick the defender into moving too quickly toward the ball, leaving an open lane directly in front of you. You can also go straight into a jump shot off the hesitation with your momentary separation. You can modify the hesitation with R2/RT, which has the effect of starting out slow before turning into a quick gallop away from coverage.</h3>
<h3>Behind the back: Move the right stick away from the basket and then quickly release to dribble behind your back. By itself, a behind the back move won’t do much, but when you string it together with an in-and-out or hesitation, you can really start fooling defenders — especially computer AI.</h3>
<h3>Crossover: One of the most effective dribble movements, the crossover is performed by rapidly moving and releasing the right stick toward your off-ball hand. String a few crossovers together with a nimble point guard, and you’re likely to leave your defender in the dust. If you’re having trouble shaking him, though, add R2/RT into the mix to execute a more forceful crossover that covers more ground.</h3>
<h3>Between the legs crossover: Even more effective than the crossover, a between the legs crossover gives you momentum to make a cut toward the basket. Again, quickly move and release the right stick in the direction of your off-ball hand, but aim it toward your backside.</h3>
<h3>Stepback: This effective for getting into open jump shots. Hold R2/RT and quickly move and release the right stick back to step back from your defender. You’ll keep your dribble, but we use the step back to get open looks with deadly jump shooters.</h3>
<h3>Half spin and spin: Helpful in eluding and surpassing coverage, rotate the right stick in a semicircle (away from the basket motion) to spin completely. To fake the defender out and continue in the original direction, rotate the right stick from the ball hand toward the hoop and then quickly release to spin halfway around before coming back.</h3>
